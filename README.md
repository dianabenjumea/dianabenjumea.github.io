 components of mining dumpers. Results in Engineering, 100934. [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590123023000610)

A good reference for engineers who intend to understand oil data and promote the development of lifetime models of components. The paper studies lifetime expectation of the main components of dumpers considering oil data. These lifetimes were analyzed by using the Cox proportional hazard model and a new robust version of the same model that is the main contribution of this work. The results show that robust version introduced has better performance than Cox classical model.

This paper presents a systematic approach to ensuring the safe operation of Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS) in regulated environments, using the UK nuclear safety regime as a case study. By formalising functional safety requirements and integrating them into a rules-based Safety System, we demonstrate compliance with industry standards. A real-world application involving an inspection robot highlights the feasibility and importance of safety assurance across the RAS lifecycle.

## PhD Thesis

**Autonomous Robotic Rules Based Reasoning System for use in UK Nuclear Environments**\
In the UK, the nuclear regulatory regime requires a safety claim to be argued and substantiated for any activity. However, existing techniques for assuring the behaviour of autonomous robotics systems, that are efficient to use regularly, are not robust enough for use in nuclear environments. The proposed research aims to develop a methodology for creating and verifying Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs) using rule-based reasoning system technology that is well-understood and amenable to mathematical verification. The methodology will involve the use of tools to capture safety requirements expressed in natural language and convert these into expressions into temporal logic, and then the use of model-checking technology to verify the SIF against these requirements. The SIF will then interact with the Autonomous Robotic system to constrain its behaviour to a safe envelope. This will be validated with a demonstration based on a use case of an inspection task with safety requirements based on avoiding collisions between the robot and its environment.
