# 🤖 CARRLOS
**Combining Autonomous Robotic Reasoning with Logical Oversight for Safety**

---

Deploying autonomous robots in safety-critical environments demands architectures that ensure operational performance and safety. **CARRLOS** is our proposed approach to meet these dual needs with formal rigor and practical transparency.

## 🚀 Our Mission
Create robust, certifiable autonomy systems for robots operating in environments where failure is not an option.

## 🎯 Key Contributions

- 🧠 **Integrated Control + Safety Reasoning**  
  A hybrid approach where autonomous decision-making is complemented by an independent safety reasoning layer.

- 🔄 **Independent Safety & Control Modules**  
  Clear separation ensures modularity and ease of certification.

- ✅ **Formal Verification**  
  The safety layer is formally verified, providing **strong safety guarantees**.

- 🔍 **Transparent Architecture & Trust Framework**  
  Methodologies that foster user trust through explainable decision-making and traceable behavior.
